\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

The performance for the final Kalman filter based track fit has been evaluated by comparing Monte Carlo truth with reconstructed data, for the key tracker measurements of $x$, $y$, $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$.  The observed performance in the transverse position and momentum measurements is excellent, for both the upstream and downstream trackers. A systematic offset in $p_z$ requires further investigation, though the spread remains acceptable.

Future Monte Carlo studies will evaluate the performance of the MICE emittance measurement.
