\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

The performance for the final Kalman filter based track fit has been evaluated by comparing Monte Carlo truth with reconstructed data, for the key tracker measurements of $x$, $y$, $p_{\perp}$ and $p_z$.  The observed performance in the transverse position and momentum measurements is excellent, for both the upstream and downstream trackers. A systematic offset in $p_z$ requires further investigation, though the resolution remains acceptable.

Future Monte Carlo studies will evaluate the performance of the MICE emittance measurement and how the resolutions of the trackers could bias the measurements.
