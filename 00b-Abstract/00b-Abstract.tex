A report on the reconstruction software of the scintillating fibre trackers of the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE). MICE will demonstrate the principle of muon beam emittance reduction via ionisation cooling for the first time, for application in future muon accelerator-based facilities, such as a Neutrino Factory or Muon Collider.  The beam emittance before and after cooling is required to be measured to high precision, which is to be achieved with two scintillating fibre trackers, one upstream and one downstream of the cooling channel.  This paper describes the reconstruction software of the fibre trackers, including the GEANT4 based simulation, geometry and configuration implementations, digitisation, spacepoint reconstruction, pattern recognition and the final track fit based on a Kalman filter. The performance of the software is evaluated by means of MC studies using momentum residuals and various other methods, and the precision of the final track parameter reconstruction evaluated.
